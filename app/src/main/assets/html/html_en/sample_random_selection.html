    <h3><strong>Random Selection of a Sample</strong></h3>

    <p>The best way to select a sample is by applying randomness.
        In this way, the sample selected is made without any preference,
        all units of the population having a probability of being selected,
        and the same for all.</p>
    <p>The units to be selected must be listed and numbered.
        From this list and numbering, random numbers can be generated to find out which units were selected.</p>
